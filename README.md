Styling Elements: Applying styles to HTML elements to define their appearance, such as size, position, and background images for the cars and the road.
CSS Animation: Using @keyframes to create smooth animations for the movement of the police car and taxi. This includes defining the start and end points of the animations and setting the duration and iteration.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the animation looks good on different screen sizes by using relative units (e.g., percentages) for positioning and sizing.
Backgrounds and Gradients: Creating a moving road effect using CSS gradients and background animations.
Advanced Selectors: Using CSS selectors to target specific elements and apply styles or animations.
